## Incredibly Fast Static Websites

Sites built with Hugo are ridiculously fast. 
This is what I used to create this site, and it's why there's basically no load time between pages. 

It's also great that it works with markdown as well as html. 
Markdown is much more readable than html, making it the perfect choice for writing content.
