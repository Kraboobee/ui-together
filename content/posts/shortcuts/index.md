This is one of the reasons I created this blog. To me, keyboard shortcuts are just as important as the syntax of whatever language you're using.

These are such small tasks, but these shortcuts just make them so much more convenient. I'm not even exaggerating when say I use them about as much as `ctrl + c` and `ctrl + v`, and I really miss them in places I can't use them.

## The Shortcuts

### Duplicate Line

```js
    // Copy line up
    Alt + Shift + Up
    
    // Copy line down
    Alt + Shift + Down
```

### Multi-cursor

```js
    // Add cursor above
    Alt + Ctrl + Up
    
    // Add cursor below
    Alt + Shift + Down
```

### Move Line

```js
    // Move line up
    Alt + Up
    
    // Move line down
    Alt + Down
```

### Others

```js
    // Find next occurrence 
    Ctrl + D

    // Toggle comment
    Ctrl + /
```

## How to use them

These shortcuts alone are incredible, but using them together changes everything.

Here's a simple example, let's say you want to edit a few lines of code. You can `Shift + Down` to highlight the original line, `Alt + Shift + Up/Down` to duplicate it, and then `Ctrl + /` to comment out the copy. It's then completely safe to try out some variations.

Here's a quick clip of me switching primary and secondary color palettes in tailwind.

These are just some basic shortcuts that I feel make a huge difference. There's a lot more built into VS Code, but If you want next level functionality straight from your keyboard, you might want to try

## VIM

hjkl, colon and Esc, Help how do I quit etc.

VIM is extremely complicated until you actually try it out. Keep an eye out for future posts, because I really love VIM.
