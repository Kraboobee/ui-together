## Incredibly Fast Static Websites

Built with go, uses markdown etc etc. We'll get to that later. 
Here's the main point:

{{< lead >}}
*It's fast.*
{{< /lead >}}

It's what I used to create this site, and it's why there's basically no load time between pages. 

It's also great that it works with markdown as well as html. 
Markdown is much more readable than html, making it the perfect choice for writing content.
